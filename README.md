## Problem

As the lockdown and corona-virus begin to subside in New Jersey, [Urban Natural Home Furniture](https://www.urbannatural.com/) is looking to re-open their showroom with half capacity, the main problem comes with controlling the:

- Number of people allowed to be in the showroom at the same time
- Number of hours allowed for each visit

## Solution

build a calendar app where we can establish safe and easy contact with customers.
So they can reserve an appointment with the manager to come to the showroom with some rules:

- Maximum of 3 people for each visit.
- Maximum hours for each visit is 2 hours.
- Comply with the business safety rules.

## User Journey

For Customers:

- As a customer, I want to be able to see available appointment slots and book any available time to visit the showroom or have a virtual meeting and add this time to the calendar to remind me.
